## How to use 
* If you are already using `create-react-app`, simply download the Components and Styles folders from Github and drop them into your application folders.
* Make sure to import both the components you need and `ck-pattern-styles.scss` into your application. 
* Note that to run sass in your application, you will need to install  `node-sass`. You can do this by running `npm install node-sass`.
* Check out the [Docs](https://zoracreates.github.io/mini-create-kit/) to see how to use the components, and the HTML that they will render.
